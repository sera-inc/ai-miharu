"""ai-guard receiver

Ingests findings from all four sources (browser extension, macOS collector,
Windows remediation, scanner CronJob) and routes them:

  severity=warn  -> Alertmanager (your alerting channel) + stdout JSON (Loki)
  severity=info  -> stdout JSON only (Loki inventory stream, no alert)
  missing        -> defaults to warn, so the existing browser extension
                    needs no change (it only ever reports violations)

Carried over from v0.1.2:
  - bearer token auth (AUTH_TOKEN)
  - optional basic auth to the log store (LOKI_USERNAME, LOKI_PASSWORD)
  - ALERT_TTL_MINUTES (default 120): persistent sessions collapse into one
    continuously active alert; Alertmanager repeat_interval governs re-pings
  - "detected" annotation pre-formatted in DISPLAY_TZ (default UTC)

New in v0.1.3:
  - severity routing (above)
  - surface field, included in the dedup/label key so a browser flag and a
    CLI flag for the same tool don't collapse into one alert
  - GET /registry: serves the registry artifact mounted from the ConfigMap
  - GET /metrics: Prometheus metrics (scraped via ServiceMonitor)

#
# ON NOT VERIFYING THE ID TOKEN SIGNATURE. The token is fetched by this
# process, over verified TLS, directly from the token endpoint named by
# the tenant's own discovery document. OpenID Connect Core 3.1.3.7 permits
# exactly this: "If the ID Token is received via direct communication
# between the Client and the Token Endpoint... the TLS server validation
# MAY be used to validate the issuer in place of checking the token
# signature." Everything a signature would not have told us is still
# checked below - issuer, audience, expiry, nonce and tenant.
#
# The alternative is a JWT library and the native cryptography stack it
# pulls in, on an image this project keeps deliberately small, for a
# guarantee the transport already gives in this flow. That trade is worth
# revisiting the day a token arrives by any route other than this one.

# believes about who somebody is comes from the host named here.
#
# So it is loud rather than clever. There is no auto-detection and no
# "looks like localhost" heuristic - a deployment either says this in so
# many words or it talks to Microsoft. When it has been said, the boot log

# Telling somebody an account has been made for them. Deliberately small:
# stdlib smtplib, no templating engine, no queue, and nothing in the message
# that is worth intercepting.
#
# ON WHAT THE INVITE CONTAINS. Nothing secret. It says an account exists and
# where to sign in, and that is all. It carries no token and sets no
# password, so an invite sitting in the wrong inbox gains its reader
# nothing they could not have guessed. The alternative - a link that sets a
# password - is a credential in an inbox, and it needs expiry, single use,
# revocation and a throttle before it is safe. That is a feature of its
# own, not a line in this one.
#
# ON NOT BLOCKING. Sending happens on a thread and its failure is reported
# rather than raised. An account is created whether or not a relay answers:
# a product that refuses to make somebody an account because the mail
# server is not set up yet has chosen its own tidiness over the operator's
# morning.
