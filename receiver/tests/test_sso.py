"""Federated sign-in: what it refuses, and what it binds to.

The flow itself is ordinary OpenID Connect. What is worth holding here is
the part that is specific to this product and easy to get wrong: which
claim an account is matched on, and the fact that no sign-in ever creates
one.

Microsoft's own guidance is the reason for the first: an address "isn't
guaranteed to be correct and is mutable over time. Never use it for
authorization", because addresses get reassigned. A joiner inheriting a
leaver's address would otherwise inherit their account and their role.
