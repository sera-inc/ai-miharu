"""The guided tour: what it points at, and what tears it down.

The suite's usual direct-call harness cannot drive a walkthrough that
lives in the browser, so what is held here is the part that rots. A tour
is a second description of the portal, written beside it and read by
nobody until somebody new signs in - so a step that points at a view
which was renamed, or an element that stopped being rendered, is wrong
for exactly as long as it takes a new colleague to find it. These read
the page's own NAV and markup and refuse a step that no longer lands.
