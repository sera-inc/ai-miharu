"""The contradictions a full review of a live deployment turned up.

Every case here was reported as "these two numbers describe the same
thing and disagree", against real data none of the existing tests
carried: an estate large enough for a person to be seen on two surfaces,
a corporate domain added after an agent last shipped, a vendor whose
users sign in on the vendor's own domain, a device that upgraded the
guard mid-window.

The fixture is synthetic and reproduces the shape, not the size. Where a
finding had exact counts they are asserted against the arithmetic the
report gave, so a regression fails with the same sum the reviewer
noticed rather than a vague inequality.
