"""The account-email and preferences proxies.

Same direct-call harness as the rest of the suite. The receiver owns
storage, validation and the role gate, so what the portal must hold is
thin and worth stating exactly: each route forwards the right verb to the
right receiver path with the operator's own session, and the preferences
routes carry no account id at all - a forwarded session is one account,
which is what keeps a layout from being addressable by anyone else.
