"""Central settings and portal-recorded governance, portal side.

The receiver stores and validates; these tests cover what the portal adds:
the per-tool merge (DB wins, file fills gaps, origin labelled), the proxy
routes forwarding exactly what was sent, and the register cache dying when
a decision changes. Same direct-call harness as the rest of the suite.
