"""Widget forms, and the charts they draw.

A form picker is the one feature here whose failure mode is a confident
picture of the wrong thing, so what these hold is the restraint: only
widgets whose data has a second honest reading may offer a choice, and
the default is always the form the widget already had.

The chart code itself is hand-written SVG - this portal ships no external
script and a chart library would be the first - so the properties worth
pinning are the ones a rewrite would quietly drop.
