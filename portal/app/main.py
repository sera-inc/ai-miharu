"""ai-guard portal.

A governance view over the findings the receiver already collects. It reads
Loki on request and derives entities: devices, identities, tools and the
relationships between them. It writes nothing, holds no database, and is not
in the path of anything that already works - if it falls over, collection
carries on.

Deliberately optional. Three deployments are equally valid: Grafana only,
portal only, or both with Grafana panels embedded here. The receiver stays
one stateless container either way.

Authentication is required, not optional. This page names who runs what on
which machine, which is the most sensitive thing the platform produces, so it
refuses to start rather than come up open by accident. Three shapes:

  managed (RECEIVER_URL set): a real login. The operator signs in with the
    admin account that lives in the receiver's state DB; the session rides
    as an HttpOnly cookie and the portal validates it against the receiver
    per request (with a short positive cache). PORTAL_USER/PORTAL_PASSWORD
    are ignored, with a warning, because two auth systems on one page is
    how one of them quietly stops being real.
  classic basic auth: PORTAL_USER and PORTAL_PASSWORD, as ever.
  PORTAL_AUTH=none: no portal auth, for localhost or behind a reverse proxy
    that authenticates. In managed mode reads are then open but admin
    actions still require the login - the receiver demands a credential
    and the session is how a person gets one.

Configuration, all optional except LOKI_URL and the auth pair:
  PORTAL_USER       basic auth username (classic mode only)
  PORTAL_PASSWORD   basic auth password (classic mode only)

Any of PORTAL_USER, PORTAL_PASSWORD, LOKI_TOKEN and LOKI_PASSWORD can be given as
NAME_FILE pointing at a file instead. Compose has no real secret story: an
environment variable is visible in docker inspect and in every child process's
environment, while a file is at least confined to the filesystem. It is not
encryption.

  PORTAL_AUTH       set to "none" to run without auth. Logs a warning on every
                    start, because an unauthenticated deployment should never
                    be something nobody noticed
  LOKI_URL          Loki base URL, e.g. http://loki:3100
  LOKI_TOKEN        bearer token, if your Loki needs one
  LOKI_USERNAME     basic auth user, for Grafana Cloud and most hosted Loki
  LOKI_PASSWORD     basic auth password, _FILE supported
  LOOKBACK_HOURS    default window, default 168
  DIGEST_WEBHOOK_URL  Slack-compatible webhook for the weekly digest;
                    DIGEST_DAY (mon..sun) and DIGEST_HOUR (UTC) tune when
  RECEIVER_ADMIN_TOKEN  the receiver's ADMIN_TOKEN, _FILE supported. Lets
                    the digest task read the log store saved through the
                    portal; without it the digest needs LOKI_URL
  REGISTRY_PATH     registry.yaml, for resolving domains to tool ids
  IDENTITY_MAP      CSV of key,identity for attaching people to devices
  GOVERNANCE_PATH   YAML of approval decisions, owners and review dates
  GRAFANA_URL       base URL of a Grafana that allows embedding; unset means
                    the dashboard shows a note instead of a broken frame
  GRAFANA_PANELS    what to embed, as "dashboardUid:panelId:Title" entries.
                    The title is the frame's accessible name, not a visible
                    caption: Grafana already renders the panel title inside
                    the frame, and showing it twice reads as a mistake.
                    Entries are separated by semicolons, not commas: Grafana
                    panel titles routinely contain commas ("Top tools
                    (devices, 7d)") and a comma separator silently split them
                    into malformed halves. Unset with GRAFANA_DASHBOARD_UID
                    set embeds the whole dashboard in one frame instead, which
                    needs no panel ids and survives someone rearranging them
  GRAFANA_DASHBOARD_UID  dashboard to embed whole, when no panels are listed
  LOKI_MAX_FINDINGS the most findings one read holds, default 100000; a
                    window with more is reported as truncated
  LOKI_READ_PARALLELISM  how many six-hour spans of the window are read from
                    Loki at once, default 1 (serial)
  LOKI_INCREMENTAL  "off" re-reads the whole window on every read; on (the
                    default) keeps it and fetches only what is new
  LOKI_RESYNC_SECONDS  even incrementally, re-read the whole window this
                    often, default 3600
  CACHE_TTL_SECONDS how long a derived graph is reused, default 30. It exists
                    to absorb a page refresh and clicking between tabs, not to
                    reduce load: Grafana runs one query per panel on every
                    refresh, so a portal page load was already the lighter of
                    the two. It started at 300, which meant a fresh install
                    showed nothing for five minutes after the first collector
                    ran, with nothing on screen saying the view was stale.

    The portal renders findings, and a finding is attacker-influenced: anyone
    holding the reporting token can put arbitrary text in a device name, and
    that token is on every collector. Escaping is the fix for that and these
    headers are what stops the next escaping mistake being exploitable.

    Be clear about what this does not do. script-src carries 'unsafe-inline',
    because the page's whole script is inline in index.html, which is served as
    a static file. So this policy does NOT stop an injected <script> tag from
    running. Making it do so means a nonce, which means templating the HTML per
    request, and that is a real change rather than a header.

    What it does stop is worth having anyway, and connect-src is most of it:
    the estate data this page can read is
    the thing worth exfiltrating, and without it a successful injection could
    read every API and post the result elsewhere. An injection that runs but
    cannot phone home is a much smaller problem than one that can.
    frame-ancestors 'none' because nothing should frame a page that names who
    runs what on which machine, and form-action 'none' because it has no forms.

    So this is a second line rather than the fix. The fix is that findings are
    escaped and nothing is interpolated into an executable context, which is
    what the tests in portal/tests hold.
