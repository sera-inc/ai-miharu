"""Managed-mode proxy and deployment-artifact generation.

The portal's CSP keeps the browser on 'self', so every admin action goes
through here to the receiver. The portal holds no write credential: the
operator's admin token arrives per request in the X-Admin-Token header, is
forwarded verbatim, and the receiver authorizes. A compromised portal
therefore yields readable findings - which it always did - and nothing that
can mint or revoke.

Artifacts are the collector scripts with the receiver URL and a freshly
minted enrollment token substituted in as *defaults*, not hardcodes: every
substitution targets the script's existing fallback syntax, so a value the
MDM supplies still wins. Corporate domains are deliberately not baked - the
receiver serves those to every collector at runtime via /registry/collector.

The scripts themselves are verified copies of endpoint/* (a test asserts
byte equality, the same pattern as the chart's bundled registry), because
the portal image cannot see the endpoint/ tree at build time.
