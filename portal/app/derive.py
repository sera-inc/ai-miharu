"""Entity derivation over ai-guard findings.

Findings are a flat stream: each one is an isolated row. Everything a
governance view needs is a relationship - which tools a device has, which
devices a person uses, who is signed into what. This module builds those
relationships. It reads; it never writes back, and it never sits in the path
of anything that already works.

The graph has two entry points, because the sources differ:

  endpoint findings  carry a device and a local username. The username is a
                     hint, not an identity: it is firstname.lastname on a
                     Jamf Connect Mac, a local account on a Mac enrolled
                     before it, the work account on Autopilot Windows, and
                     whatever the person chose on unmanaged Linux. The device
                     is the reliable key.

  cloud findings     carry an identity and no device, because Entra and
                     Exchange know people, not machines.

They meet at the person, and that join is a lookup the deployer owns against
whatever they run: Jamf, Intune, an RMM, a CMDB, a CSV. This module does not
attempt it. Devices with no mapped person stay unattributed, which is a
first-class state and not an error - a small team with no MDM still gets
"these three machines are running Ollama on personal accounts", and that is
useful without a name on it.

    """Pull findings from Loki, paginating until the window is exhausted.

    Loki caps one query_range response at `limit` entries. The old single
    request silently returned the newest 5,000 of a larger window, and
    every portal number - the register, the status page, the evidence
    manifest with its checksum - was then computed over a sample presented
    as the whole (issue #104). Now the read walks backward page by page
    until a page comes back short, or max_findings is hit - and hitting
    the cap is REPORTED, not swallowed: the result's truncated flag rides
    into the API responses and the evidence manifest.

    The boundary between pages is oldest-seen minus one nanosecond, so a
    finding sharing that exact nanosecond with the boundary entry could be
    skipped; receiver timestamps are time_ns() at ingest, which makes that
    collision effectively impossible.

    Two authentication shapes, because log stores disagree about which they
    want. A bearer token covers self-hosted Loki behind a gateway; basic
    auth is what Grafana Cloud and most hosted offerings use, where the
    username is a numeric instance id. Both may be set: a gateway that
    wants a bearer in front of a Loki that wants basic auth is a real
    arrangement. Built by hand rather than with HTTPBasicAuthHandler,
    which only sends credentials after a 401 with a realm it recognises -
    Grafana Cloud answers 401 without one, so the retry never carried the
    header.

    parallel > 1 splits the window into six-hour spans and walks several at
    once, newest first. One page at a time made a read's cost the number of
    pages times one round trip - twenty in series for a capped window - and
    Loki answers a page in about the same time wherever it sits in the
    window, so the pages were only ever waiting on each other. Spans are
    merged newest first, and the cap still means the newest max_findings:
    once the newest completed spans hold that many, no older span is asked
    for, and whether anything older existed is answered with one entry
    rather than assumed.

    start_ns and end_ns replace the window with an exact one, for a reader
    that already holds everything older.

    """One row per tool: what the registry knows, joined to what was observed.

    Returns the full join, observed and not. Callers decide what to show: the
    register itself is the observed set, and the rest is the count of what is
    being watched for.

    That distinction matters and it took a wrong turn to find. A register is a
    record of what an organisation actually uses. Listing every entry in a
    shipped registry makes it a worse record, not a more complete one: it puts
    tools nobody there has heard of in front of a management review as though
    the organisation has a position on them. The registry is a watchlist, and a
    watchlist is context rather than inventory.

    The project's rule that silence is not evidence of safety applies to
    sources, not to this. A collector that stops reporting looks identical to a
    clean machine, so silent sources must be listed. A registry entry is not a
    source: a tool absent from findings is the registry correctly not matching
    something that is not there, and coverage gaps are answered by Setup and
    Uncovered devices.

    A tool observed and NOT in the registry is the row that matters most.
    Something is in use that governance has never considered, and it is flagged
    rather than quietly folded in.

    Governance fields (owner, review date, risk decision) are not derivable and
    are absent here. The page shows them as not set rather than hiding them,
    because a register that looks complete while missing the decisions is worse
    than one with visible gaps. When those decisions exist, an unobserved tool
    carrying one becomes a register row again: at that point it is a record of
    something the organisation decided, rather than a default nobody chose.
