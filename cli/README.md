Upgrade a Shadow AI Guard deployment from your own machine, with your own
credentials, while the portal shows the progress.

The portal tells you a newer release exists. It never applies one: nothing in
the cluster or on the compose host holds a right it did not have, and the
portal has no code path that runs `helm`, `kubectl` or `docker`. This command
does, on your machine, with the kubeconfig context or Docker context you
already use to administer the deployment. The platform's part is to check
that an owner asked for the upgrade, to describe what is running, and to
hold the progress so System health can show it live - including while the
portal itself restarts. The design and its threat model are in
[SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md), under *Upgrading*.

## Install

It needs Python 3.10 or newer and `pipx` (`brew install pipx` on a Mac,
`pip install --user pipx` elsewhere). From a tagged release of this
repository, once:

    pipx install -q "git+https://github.com/AmanSK5/shadow-ai-guard@v0.35.0#subdirectory=cli"
    pipx ensurepath

`pipx ensurepath` puts the command on your PATH; a shell opened before that
will not find it until it is reopened.

No third-party dependencies, so what runs is what the tag contains. It
shells out to your own `helm`, `kubectl` and `docker`, found on your PATH.

## Upgrade

    aiguardctl upgrade --portal https://ai-guard-portal.example.com

1. It reads what is deployed with your tools: the chart's Deployments and any
   CronJobs running this project's scanner or discovery images on
   Kubernetes, or the compose services running this project's images.
2. Your browser opens the portal's approval page. Sign in as you always do -
   password, or Microsoft Entra with your tenant's MFA. An **owner** compares
   the code on the page with the one in your terminal and approves. The
   command never sees a password and never learns which sign-in you use.
3. It shows the plan - every object it will touch and every command it will
   run - and waits for `y`.
4. It runs them: `helm upgrade --reuse-values` on a Helm release, image bumps
   on a bare Kubernetes install, `pull` and `up -d` for the named services on
   compose. Each step is reported to the portal; command output stays in
   your terminal.
5. It waits for the portal to answer as the new version, checks the receiver
   did too and that detection sources are reporting, and records the
   outcome.

Options: `--dry-run` prints the plan and runs and approves nothing;
`--yes` skips the confirmation for automation; `--context` and
`--namespace` pick a cluster and a release when you have more than one;
`--version` targets a release other than the latest; `--kubernetes` or
`--compose` stops it looking at the other.

## Move to Nyxus

    export NYXUS_KEY='<your activation key>'
    aiguardctl upgrade --edition nyxus --portal https://ai-guard-portal.example.com --nyxus-version <version>

Moves the deployment to Nyxus in place: the receiver's database, its storage
and its credentials are kept, and Nyxus reads the findings already in your
log store. The key is read from `NYXUS_KEY` or `--key-file`, checked against
the key stored in the deployment, and never put on a command line. On Helm it
backs up the database, carries the release's Secrets, stops the receiver and
the portal, uninstalls the release and installs Nyxus on the same storage
claim. Where the Tailscale operator serves the release's Ingresses it names
their machines in the plan, and if the operator cannot delete them it asks you
to in the admin console, then releases those Ingresses. On Docker Compose, name Nyxus's
compose file with `--nyxus-compose-file`, in a directory of its own.
`--nyxus-release` names the Helm release. `--dry-run` shows every step first.
The full account is [docs/upgrading-to-nyxus.md](../docs/upgrading-to-nyxus.md).

## What it will not do

Touch an object without the chart's labels or this project's image. Run a
command it did not show you. Put an activation key on a command line. Send
command output to the portal. Keep the token: it lives in memory for one run
and is retired when the run finishes. Upgrade a compose project whose images
were built locally rather than pulled from the registry - it says so and
stops.
